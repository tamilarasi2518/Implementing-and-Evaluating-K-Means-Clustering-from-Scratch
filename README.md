# Implementing-and-Evaluating-K-Means-Clustering-from-Scratch
This project involves implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using NumPy. You will generate a synthetic 2D dataset, test different cluster counts, compute metrics like inertia, visualize results, and write an analysis explaining how the choice of K affects clustering performance and efficiency.
